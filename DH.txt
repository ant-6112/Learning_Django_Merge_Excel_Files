- When you generally work on Projects in you Undergrad, It is like you are building it for Yourself and the Professor you'll be showing it to. But when you are working on projects that could be potentially be used by many people. You become very entitled to the Problems pertaining it so if there is any issues that originates with the user it's your responsibility to solve it.
- In our Team we Particularly had 1 Person per project so I was directly responsible for the whole phase which is
    - Discovery : In which you get to know the Pain Points of the users on their particular tasks with a directly conversation.
    - Design : Documents on how we would approach the problem or issues at hand and listing down the requirements for that project.
    - Build : Actual Development of the Projects.
    - UAT : Testing which we Submit to the Users so they can see our tool and report any issues for it.
    - Production : Final Delivery of the Project to the Users.
- Projects that I Worked On :

    - Ram assigned us a task to Build a simple Command Line Application for a Recurring Deposit Calculator that takes in 3 Inputs :
        - Principal Amount
        - Interest Rate (Annual)
        - Tenure
    - Then by a very Simple Formula to Calculate :
        - Recurring Deposit that is gonna be paid by the user for each month.
        - Maturity Amount
        - Total Yield which is just the Principal Amount - Maturity Amount
- Loan Amortisation Calculator (Python) : Python was the easiest to build as I was already experienced with Tkinter and it wasn't difficult to configure as I already had core run process of the Calculator built.
- Loan Amortisation Calculator (VBA) : VBA was also wasn't too difficult as I already knew the Logic of the Code from previous iterations and I just had to replicate that using Visual Basic Syntax. The only difficulty that I faced was using was printing the Schedule into a Excel Sheet as I had to Interact with the Sheet using Range Selectors which was a bit of a challenge.

- HSBC has definetly exceeded the Expectations for me. Now, It's definitely a huge change when you are straight out of college thrown out in these corporate environments, and You have this dreaded feeling of these how the corporate lifestyle is gonna be as I have definitely heard the Stories of Beauracracy and Work Life that make you tremble but I think starting with HSBC has been very good checkpoint for me and I have got the chance to meet some fantastic leadership and collabrate with amazing people both at the Chennai Team and NCR Team. The 2 Key Things that I would highlight would be the Agile Working Methodology that HSBC particularly is practiced within all of HSBC but our Team is doing a better job at it and would be the Design Thinking Approach of doing Projects.
